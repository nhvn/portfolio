I created this project around Halloween, so I decided to make it Halloween-themed. I designed some elements of the game from scratch, like the black barriers that players should avoid touching, or they lose. The game has room for improvement, but considering my knowledge at the time, I think it is awesome. Please feel free to try it out if you dare. It is a challenging game, so do not hesitate to give it multiple attempts.',
